### Added
- Changelog.
- Asciicast importer plugin.

See the [asciicast scene](/examples/asciicast) for example usage.

### Changed
- Implementation of Terminal node from GDScript to GDNative using [Aetf's patched version of libtsm](https://github.com/Aetf/libtsm).
- Move input handling to the Terminal node itself, rather than handling it in a seperate Control node.
