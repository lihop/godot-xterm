# Demos and Examples

The GodotXterm repository contains several example scenes in the [`/examples`](https://github.com/lihop/godot-xterm/tree/main/examples) directory.
If cloning the repo, you will need to either build the GDExtension binaries from source (see [Building from source](/development/building_from_source.md)) or copy pre-compiled binaries into the project (see [Get the files](/getting_started/installation.md#get-the-files) for an idea of how these files can be obtained).

Other examples of GodotXterm usage are available online:
